Softmacs is a modern Lisp distribution that combines programming
language theory & machine learning.

Softmacs Lisp is based on [[https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html][John Shutt's Kernel]]: it uses the ~vau~
operator to create /fexprs/, essentially first class macros. It also
has delimited continuations, and primitives from synchronous reactive
programming.

With regards to machine learning, my current idea is to write neural
sequence-to-sequence models in Lisp and apply them to Lisp tokens. I
would like to be able to perform the entire machine learning workflow
from within Softmacs. For example, Softmacs should be able to scrape
web pages to collect a dataset, define models, train them, then deploy
them in embedded apps like the browser or messaging clients.
